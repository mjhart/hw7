function rating=arrangeCircles(pos)
% Given circles of radii 1, 2, 3, ... 10, you want to arrange them in the
% plane so that a) they do not overlap, and b) they are contained in the
% smallest possible square (with sides parallel to the axes). The return
% value "rating" is the side length of this square, or 1000 if the circles
% overlap. The input, "pos", consists of 20 numbers, interpreted as the x
% and y positions of the center of the circle of radius 1, followed by the
% x and y positions of the center of the circle of radius 2, etc.
